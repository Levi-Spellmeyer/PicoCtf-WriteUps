1. used wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/108/enc_flag to download th given file and ls to confirm it downloaded

2. cat the filr and got a long string of random characters

3. file is named enc_flag so i can assume its encoded before even cat it

4. tried ls -a to see if any other files were downloaded

5. plugged string into a decoder at https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher and did not get anything useful

6. used base64 -d to try and see if it base64 and it does not appear so

7. started researching other decryption methods

8. tried gpg --decrypt did not work

9. went back to base 64 decode and got this string 
- b'YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclgyZzBOMm8yYXpZNWZRPT0nCg=='

10 i decided i would try running base 64 again on the string and it failed so on a wim i removed the b'' and got 
- wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_h47j6k69}

note this looks a lot like a flag and as it is all numbers and letters i rand the string through the above mentioned website and got the key as follows
-	picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_a47c6d69}

The biggest rabbit hole i faced was figuring out that the string was encoded multiple times
